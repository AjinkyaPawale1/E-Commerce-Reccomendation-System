# E-Commerce Recommendation System

Recommendation systems are broadly classified into two categories- 1. content based filtering and 2. collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating)

In this project, we present the workings of four different models under the collaborative filtering approach of recommendation systems. The four different models are k-nearest neighbors, stochastic gradient descent, alternating least squares and deep learning based neural collaborative filtering. We have used open-source available amazon datasets containing the user and item metadata and we demonstrate how these models work and perform on this given data to recommend new products to customers. Also, we demonstrate how to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using different metrics such as hit ratio and mean absolute error.
